title: Tricks with Classes in Java
---


## Anonymous classes with instance variables and initializer
```java
int myVariable = 1;

myButton.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {
    private int anonVar;
    public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
        // How would one access myVariable here?        i
        // It's now here:
        System.out.println("Initialized with value: " + anonVar);
    }
    private ActionListener init(int var){
        anonVar = var;
        return this;
    }
}.init(myVariable)  );
```
Here, we instantiate a anonymous `ActionListener` that implements a method (`actionPerformed`) and also
allows to pass parameters to the class. This is done via the `init` method that is called immediately
after creating the class and returning a reference to itself.

## Using local classes to simulate nested functions
Local classes are a feature that is rarely used, but nonetheless can be useful. Any method can contain
local classes and the scope of this class is the method. Local classes cannot be public or private, but 
can contain static content, including static methods.
```java
  public void writeConfig() {
    class Foo {
      static void bar() {
        IO.println("Local class bar method");
      }
    }
    [...]
    Foo.bar();
  }
```
Here the `class Foo` is local to the method `writeConfig()` and it's static method `bar()` can be used 
in the method only. You could also use non-static methods and use them by instantiating a `Foo` object 
like `new Foo().bar();`. An instantiated local class has access to the members of the enclosing class and 
also to any **final** variable in the enclosing method. Local classes are often used to create helper 
methods that are not needed elsewhere.
