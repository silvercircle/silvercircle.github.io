## Dynamic Dispatching
Dynamic Dispatching is the mechanism that determines which primitive needs to be called for an object instance 
when this object is part of a class hierarchy. This always happens when the compiler cannot figure this 
out during compile time. In such cases, dynamic dispatching must do it at runtime, because the actual 
type of an object can differ from the declared type. This is a key feature that allows runtime 
polymorphism.

(gloss_controlling_parameter)=
## Controlling Parameter
The parameter that links a primitive subprogram to a tagged record. is the parameter of a tagged type 
that determines which version of a dispatching operation gets called at runtime.

```{code-block} ada

type Person is tagged record
  name : String;
  age :  Integer;
end record;
type Person_Access is access all Person;

-- Greet1 and Greet2 are dispatchable primitives. Both have a tagged record as
-- its first argument. So if foo is of Type Person, you can call foo.Greet1;
-- or Greet1(foo);
procedure Greet1(Self : in out Person);
procedure Greet2(Self : access Person);

-- Greet3 is not dispatchable, because Person_Access is its own type and is not
-- a tagged type. It only accesses a tagged type, which in Ada's strict type system
-- is a different thing. 
procedure Greet3(Self : Person_Access);
