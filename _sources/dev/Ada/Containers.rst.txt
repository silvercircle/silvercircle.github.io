Containers in Ada
=================
Most containers are implemented as generic packages which must be instantiated with actual types. In it 
simplest form, a generic package has one or more formal types, which are placeholders for real data 
types. A nice introduction into generics can be found `here <https://learn.adacore.com/courses/intro-to-ada/chapters/generics.html>`_
