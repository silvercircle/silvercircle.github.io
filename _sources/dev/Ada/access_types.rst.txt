Ada Access Types
================
This document contains a loose number of notes about access types in Ada. This is a complex topic with 
quite some pitfalls 

Implicit Dereference
--------------------

Consider the type:
""""""""""""""""""

.. code-block:: ada
  :linenos:

  type LF_Ref (Element : not null access Real) is null record with
    Implicit_Dereference => Element;

This defines an access type ``LF_Ref`` to access variables of type ``Real`` (just another name for a 
``Long_Float``) which implicitly dereferences ``Element``. Now, this is really a record type with 
``Element`` as its single member and discriminant and whenever you use a variable of this type to access 
a ``Real`` value, it will automatically dereference and allows read/write access to its target.


Consider
""""""""

.. code-block:: ada
  :linenos:

  type AuxAngleClass is tagged record
    xx : aliased Real := 1.0;
    yy : aliased Real := 0.0;
  end record;

  AA : AuxAngleClass := (xx => 0.0, yy => 0.0);
  R  : LF_Ref := Aux_Angle.xx;

This will give you an access type to ``AA.xx`` but you do not have to use ``.all`` in order to access the 
target value. You can do something like :ada:`R := 12.3;` and
