# Containers in Ada
  Most containers are implemented as generic packages which must be instantiated with actual types. In it 
  simplest form, a generic package has one or more formal types, which are placeholders for real data 
  types. A nice introduction into generics can be found [here](https://learn.adacore.com/courses/intro-to-ada/chapters/generics.html).
