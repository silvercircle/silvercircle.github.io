This is a software port of the `Geographic Lib <https://geographiclib.sourceforge.io/index.html>`_ to the 
*Ada programming language*. It is work in progress and as of now not a complete product. Basic 
functionality is working, but many features provided by the original implementation are missing.

The original C++ library, on which this port is partially based on (some parts are ported from the Java 
implementation) was written and is copyrighted by `Charles Karney <mailto:karney@alum.mit.edu>`_. The 
work was released under the free `MIT/X11 License`_.

Motivation

.. code-block:: ada
   :linenos:
   :caption: Sample Code
   :name: sample_ada

   procedure Add_Edge (Self : in out PolygonAreaClass; azi, s : Long_Float)
   is
   begin
    --- Do nothing if num is zero
      if Self.num > 0 then
      declare
        gd : constant GeodesicResult := Self.gd.Direct (Self.lat1, Self.lon1, azi, s, Self.imask);
      begin
        Self.perimetersum.Add (gd.s12);
        if not Self.polyline then
          Self.areasum.Add (gd.area12);
          Self.crossings := Self.crossings + Transit_Direct (Self.lon1, gd.lon2);
        end if;
        Self.lat1 := gd.lat2;Self.lon1 := gd.lon2;
        Self.num  := Self.num + 1;
      end;
    end if;
   end Add_Edge;

This is mainly an exercise to refresh my knowledge in the Ada programming language. I've chosen this 
library, because I've been using the Java version elsewhere and found it to be an excellent piece of 
software.

Current Status
--------------

As of now (January 2026) the following parts are done.

* The basic mathematics support functions in the :doc:`Geomath package <api/geomath>`.
* Most of the :doc:`Geodesic package <api/geodesic>`

:ref:`scratchpad`

Math test:

Since Pythagoras, we know that :math:`a^2 + b^2 = c^2`.

:math:`\frac{ \sum_{t=0}^{N}f(t,k) }{N}`

Documents the ``Make`` procedure.

This describes a function.

.. ada:procedure:: procedure Make (i, l : Integer) return FooClass

   This creates an record of :ada:type:`GeoMath.FooClass`

.. ada:type:: type Mask_Type
