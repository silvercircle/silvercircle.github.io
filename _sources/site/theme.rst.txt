Site Theme
==========
This site uses the `Furo theme <https://github.com/pradyunsg/furo/tree/main/src/furo/theme/furo>`_ with 
some customization.

Supported page variables
------------------------
Page variables take the form ``variable: value`` in reStructuredText documents (note the space, it's 
important). In MyST documents, they can be defined in the page's frontmatter.

lang
  define the language for a single document page. By default, the site is using ``en`` for all pages, but 
  this can be changed for single pages, should it be necessary.
  A `valid lang attribute <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/lang>`_ 
  in form of a ISO 639 language code is the only allowable value. It will result in ``<html lang="xx">`` 
  where xx is the supplied language code.

layout
  Allows to supply additional style sheets to change the value. Right now, the following values are 
  allowed:

  * ``mobile``: This will hide the static left and right sidebars and add small display navigation 
    elements. There will be *hamburger* buttons to open the sidebars on demand.
  * ``solopage``: Will completely remove all navigation elements and display the page alone.

  Both ``mobile`` and ``solopage`` can be used for a distraction-free layout which is normally used on 
  mobile devices. These options enables this layout on all screen resolutions.

nonav
  When present and set to ``True``, the bottom navigation buttons for the previous and next page(s) are 
  hidden.

Implementation
--------------
In ``conf.py``, a ``html-page-context`` event handler is registered. The function ``handle_metadata`` 
analyzes the page context and uses ``app.add_css_file`` to add the css style sheets required for the layout 
modifications.

The function uses a dictionary to map the value of ``layout`` to stylesheet names and adds them. It also 
rewrites the ``language`` attribute in the page's context. Future additions may be implemented to 
dynamically modify sidebar content.

Pygments Configuration
----------------------
:doc:`This document <pygments>` describes how to use a python class to define a custom syntax highlighting scheme.
